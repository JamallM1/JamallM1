# Hi, I'm Jamall!

Hi there! My name is Jamall Malik and I am¬†a software developer living in Gainesville, Florida. I'm a United States Air Force Veteran¬†who enjoys fast-paced settings where there are opportunities for me to learn new things. I've been learning to code because I aspire to make my thoughts a reality. I've worked with Python, Javascript, React, and Node.js. My goal is to work for a company that will help me to grow professionally and personally.
When I'm not programming, I like to play basketball, work out, travel, and spend time with my friends and family.


Please get in touch with me on the following social media platforms; I enjoy building new relationships. I am excited to continue to learn and grow in this career field!
